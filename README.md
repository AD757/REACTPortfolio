# Personal portfolio site (V.1)
For this project I created my first personal portfolio site to practice React, original created by Paul Hanna's youtube series. 
Put my own touch and created own things along like calling an API weather from my current city & contact form. 

This is a template portfolio. My actuall portfolio is [here](https://www.alladindaher.se/)
